I'll create the following pages with full HTML/CSS/JS:
1. universities.html + universities-styles.css + universities-script.js
2. scholarships.html + scholarships-styles.css + scholarships-script.js  
3. visa-guide.html + visa-guide-styles.css + visa-guide-script.js
4. job-prospects.html + job-prospects-styles.css + job-prospects-script.js

Due to message length constraints, I'll create these efficiently as fully functional standalone pages.
